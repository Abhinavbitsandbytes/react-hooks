-> Hooks are as new feature addition in React version 16.8 which allow you to uae React features without having to write class.

ex- state of a component

->Hooks don't work inside classes

->why Hooks?
reason set 1
* understand how this keyword works in javascript
*remember to bind event hanblers in class components
*classes don't minify very well and make hot reloading very unreliable.

reason set 2
*there is no particular way to reuse stateful component logic
*HOC and render props patterns do address this problem
*Makes the code harder to follow
*there is need to share stateful logic in a better way.

reeason set 3
*Releted code is not organised in one place
Ex- Data fetching-In ComponentDidMount and ComponentDidUpdate
Ex- Event Listeners-In componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount
because of stateful logic-cannot breaks components into smaller ones
